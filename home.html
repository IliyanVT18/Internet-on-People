            The Internet is a service we use pretty much every single day. If you're anything like me, you probably spend hours and hours of your day browsing through reddit memes or YouTube videos.
            Matter is, the Internet was designed with this addictive behaviour in mind.

            <span class="initialletter">T</span>he main cause for the Internet being so easily addictive is the constant stream of information. If you get bored in any situation, you know that if you simply take out your phone and 
            look at Instagram, you'll surely find something to entertain yourself with. This not only harms productivity, but also affects our attention spans in the long run. A 
            <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/newscentre/news_centre/more_news_stories/research_reveals_how_the_internet_may_be_changing_the_brain" class="underline">study made by Oxford, King's 
            College, Western Sydney University and Harvard</a> , found that high levels of Internet use phisically impact the brain, noting that those who spent more time distracted online showed lower 
            amounts of grey matter in the cerebral areas associated with keeping focus.

            This same basis applies to videogames, gambling, pretty much any activity. Based on the knowledge that, as long as the user thinks that they will get some satisfaction from the 
            activity, they will keep on taking part in said activity. For instance, when gambling, the person gambling knows that they might lose some money, but they also know that they 
            might win some, which is enough to keep them going. When it comes to videogames, it's a bit more complicated, since the addiction stems from whether the game is fun or not, and from 
            what reward the user gets for playing daily.

            In fact, there are some games that took this so far, they ruined people's entire lives. This was the case of <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/wowclassic" class="underline">World of Warcraft</a>
            back when it came out in 2004. The main advantage World of Warcraft had was that there was so much stuff to do. There were tons and tons of players playing, there were many rewarding, time consuming challenges, and 
            it got to the point where people were completely ignoring real life just so as to obtain a special item or achievement, which acted as somewhat of a status symbol inside the World of 
            Warcraft community. There exist many people who have lost friends, jobs, pets, have deteriorated their health, etc. all because of this one videogame.
